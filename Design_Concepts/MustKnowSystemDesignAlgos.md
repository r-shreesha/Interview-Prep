System Design Algorithms Every Engineer Should Know. 👇

## 1. 𝐁𝐥𝐨𝐨𝐦 𝐅𝐢𝐥𝐭𝐞𝐫

* A space-efficient probabilistic data structure used to **test whether an element is a member of a set**.
* False positives are possible, but false negatives are not ==> Deterministic "No" if element is absent, Probably "Yes", if present

### Use Cases
* Checking if a username is available.
* Identifying potentially malicious URLs in a web crawler.


## 2. 𝐅𝐫𝐮𝐠𝐚𝐥 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐠
* A memory-efficient algorithm **to compute quantiles** (e.g., median, percentiles) over streaming data.

### Use Cases
* Real-time monitoring of website response times.
* Analyzing large-scale sensor data.


## 3. 𝐆𝐞𝐨𝐡𝐚𝐬𝐡/𝐒2 𝐆𝐞𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐭𝐫𝐲
* Geospatial indexing systems that divide the Earth's surface into hierarchical grids for **efficient spatial queries**.

### Use Cases
* Location-based services (finding nearby restaurants, stores ).
* Proximity searches (matching users based on location).


## 4. 𝐇𝐲𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐋𝐨𝐠𝐋𝐨𝐠:
* A probabilistic algorithm for **estimating the number of distinct elements (cardinality) in a data set** with high accuracy and low memory usage.

### Use Cases
* Counting unique visitors to a website.
* Analyzing user behavior patterns.


## 5. 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐤𝐲 𝐁𝐮𝐜𝐤𝐞𝐭/𝐓𝐨𝐤𝐞𝐧 𝐁𝐮𝐜𝐤𝐞𝐭
* Algorithms used **to control the rate of traffic flow** in a network or system, preventing overload.

### Use Cases
* Rate limiting API requests.
* Smoothing out bursty traffic.


## 6. 𝐋𝐨𝐬𝐬𝐲 𝐂𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐭
* An algorithm for **finding frequent items in a data stream**, particularly when memory is limited. It allows for some error to save space.

### Use Cases
* Identifying trending topics on social media.
* Finding popular products in an e-commerce store.


## 7. 𝐎𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 (𝐎𝐓)
* A technique for **enabling concurrent editing of shared documents** while maintaining consistency.

### Use Cases
* Collaborative text editors (like Google Docs).
* Real-time code collaboration tools.
* Collaborative drawing applications.


## 8. 𝐐𝐮𝐚𝐝𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐞/𝐑-𝐓𝐫𝐞𝐞
* Data structures for **indexing multi-dimensional data** (e.g., spatial data).

### Use Cases
* Spatial databases.
* Collision detection in video games.


## 9. 𝐑𝐚𝐲 𝐂𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠
* A technique in computer graphics used **to determine which objects in a scene are intersected by a ray** (e.g., from the viewer's eye).

### Use Cases
* Rendering 3D scenes.
* Line of sight calculations.
* Hidden surface removal.


## 10. 𝐑𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐞 𝐈𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐱
* A data structure that **maps terms (words or phrases) to the documents containing them**.

### Use Cases
* Full-text search engines.
* Document retrieval systems.


## 11. 𝐑𝐬𝐲𝐧𝐜 𝐀𝐥𝐠𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐡𝐦
* A file synchronization algorithm that **minimizes data transfer by only sending differences between files**.

### Use Cases
* File backups.
* Remote file synchronization.
* Version control systems.
