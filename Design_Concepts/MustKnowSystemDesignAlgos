System Design Algorithms Every Engineer Should Know. 👇

1. 𝐁𝐥𝐨𝐨𝐦 𝐅𝐢𝐥𝐭𝐞𝐫
◾ A space-efficient probabilistic data structure used to test whether an element is a member of a set.
◾ False positives are possible, but false negatives are not ==> Deterministic "No" if element is absent, Probably "Yes", if present

Use Cases
◾ Checking if a username is available.
◾ Identifying potentially malicious URLs in a web crawler.
etc.

2. 𝐅𝐫𝐮𝐠𝐚𝐥 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐠
◾ A memory-efficient algorithm to compute quantiles (e.g., median, percentiles) over streaming data.

Use Cases
◾ Real-time monitoring of website response times.
◾ Analyzing large-scale sensor data.
etc.

3. 𝐆𝐞𝐨𝐡𝐚𝐬𝐡/𝐒2 𝐆𝐞𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐭𝐫𝐲
◾ Geospatial indexing systems that divide the Earth's surface into hierarchical grids for efficient spatial queries.

Use Cases
◾ Location-based services (finding nearby restaurants, stores, etc.).
◾ Proximity searches (matching users based on location).
etc.

4. 𝐇𝐲𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐋𝐨𝐠𝐋𝐨𝐠:
◾ A probabilistic algorithm for estimating the number of distinct elements (cardinality) in a data set with high accuracy and low memory usage.

Use Cases
◾ Counting unique visitors to a website.
◾ Analyzing user behavior patterns.
etc.

5. 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐤𝐲 𝐁𝐮𝐜𝐤𝐞𝐭/𝐓𝐨𝐤𝐞𝐧 𝐁𝐮𝐜𝐤𝐞𝐭
◾ Algorithms used to control the rate of traffic flow in a network or system, preventing overload.

Use Cases
◾ Rate limiting API requests.
◾ Smoothing out bursty traffic.
etc.

6. 𝐋𝐨𝐬𝐬𝐲 𝐂𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐭
◾ An algorithm for finding frequent items in a data stream, particularly when memory is limited. It allows for some error to save space.

Use Cases
◾ Identifying trending topics on social media.
◾ Finding popular products in an e-commerce store.
etc.

7. 𝐎𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 (𝐎𝐓)
◾ A technique for enabling concurrent editing of shared documents while maintaining consistency.

Use Cases
◾ Collaborative text editors (like Google Docs).
◾ Real-time code collaboration tools.
◾ Collaborative drawing applications.
etc.

8. 𝐐𝐮𝐚𝐝𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐞/𝐑-𝐓𝐫𝐞𝐞
◾ Data structures for indexing multi-dimensional data (e.g., spatial data).

Use Cases
◾ Spatial databases.
◾ Collision detection in video games.
etc.

9. 𝐑𝐚𝐲 𝐂𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠
◾ A technique in computer graphics used to determine which objects in a scene are intersected by a ray (e.g., from the viewer's eye).

Use Cases
◾ Rendering 3D scenes.
◾ Line of sight calculations.
◾ Hidden surface removal.
etc.

10. 𝐑𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐞 𝐈𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐱
◾ A data structure that maps terms (words or phrases) to the documents containing them.

Use Cases
◾ Full-text search engines.
◾ Document retrieval systems.
etc.

11. 𝐑𝐬𝐲𝐧𝐜 𝐀𝐥𝐠𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐡𝐦
◾ A file synchronization algorithm that minimizes data transfer by only sending differences between files.

Use Cases
◾ File backups.
◾ Remote file synchronization.
◾ Version control systems.
etc.
