# System design
## Key Characteristics of a Distributed System
| Key | Strategies |
|---|---|
| Scalability | Horizontal, Vertical|
| Availability | Redundancy & Replication, Load Balancing, Distributed Data Storage, Health Monitoring & Alerts, Regular System Maintenance & Updates, Geographic Distribution | 
| Latency & Performance | Data Locality, Load Balancing, Caching |
| Monitoring & Observability | Metrics Collection, Distributed Tracing, Logging, Alerting & Anomaly Detection, Visualization & Dashboards |
| Resiliencey & Error handling | Fault Tolerance, Graceful Degradation (Circuit Breakers, Timeouts, Fallbacks), Retry & Backoff, Logging errors & Generating Alerts, Chaos Engineering |
