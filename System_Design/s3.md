# What is Object Storage

- In comparison to file and block storage, Object storage is new. It makes a very deliberate tradeoff to `sacrifice performance` for `high durability, vast scale and low cost`.
- Object Storage targets "cold" data and is mainly used for archival and backup.
- Object Storage stores all data as objects in a `flat` structure. There is no hierarchical directory structure.
- Data access is normally provided via a RESTful API. It is relatively slow compared to other storage types.
- Ensures `Strong Consistency` similar to block and file storage

## Comparison

| | Block Storage | File Storage | Object Storage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cost | High | Medium to High | Low |
| Performance | Medium to very High | Medium to High | Low to medium |
| Data Access | iSCSI/FC protocols | Standard file access, CIFS/SMB, NFS | RESTful API |
| Scalability | Medium | High | Vast |
| Good for | VM, High Performance Apps like DB | General purpose file system access | Binary data, unstructured data, video, images |
| Mutable Content | Y | Y | N (object versioning is supported, in place update is not) |

### Terminology

- **Bucket**. A logical container for objects. The bucket name is globally unique.
- **Object**. An object is an individual piece of data we store in a bucket. It contains object data(also called payload) and metadata.
  * Object data. can be any sequence of data we need to store.
  * Metadata. Set of name-value pairs that describe the object.
- **Versioning**. A feature that keeps multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. This is enabled at bucket level. This enables users to recover objects that are deleted or overwritten accidentally
- **Uniform Resouce Identifier (URI)**. Object storage provides RESTful APIs to access its resources - buckets and objects. Each resource is uniquely identified by its URI
- **Service Level Agreement(SLA)**. This is a contract between service provider adn a client. Example, S3 Standard Infrequent Access storage class provides the following SLA:
    * Designed for durability of 99.999999999% of objects across multiple Availability zones.
    * Data is resilient in the event of one entire Availability Zone destruction.
  

## Understanding Requirements
C: What features should be included in the design?

I: Create Buckets, List Buckets, Object uploading, Object download, Object Versioning, Listing objects within a bucket, similar to `aws s3 ls`

C: What is the typical data size?

I: We need to store massive objects(few GBs) and a number of small objects(tens of KBs) efficiently

C: How much data do we need to store in one year?

I: 100 petabytes (PB)

C: What are some of the non-functional requirements we need?

I: Data durability is 6 nines, Service availability is 4 nines, 100PB of data, Storage Efficiency. Reduce Storage costs while maintaining high degree of reliability and performance

### Estimation

Disk Capacity: Let's assume 20% small objects(< 1MB), 60% medium sized objects (1MB - 64MB), 20% large objects (> 64MB)
IOPS: 1 hard disk(7200 rpm) is capable of doing 100 ~ 150 random seeks per second (100 ~ 150 IOPS)

With this assumption, 40% usage ratio implies 0.68 billion objects. If each metadata is 1KB in size, we need 0.68TB space to store them.
